# Parent Role Implementation - SFCG School Management System

## Overview

The Parent Role is a comprehensive role-based access control system that provides parents with the ability to monitor their children's academic progress, view grades, honor status, and certificates. This system is designed to keep parents informed about their children's educational achievements while maintaining data security and privacy.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend Components
- **Middleware**: `ParentMiddleware` - Ensures only users with parent role can access parent routes
- **Routes**: Dedicated `routes/parent.php` file with comprehensive endpoint coverage
- **Controllers**: 5 main controllers handling different aspects of parent functionality
- **Models**: Enhanced `User` model with parent-student relationship methods
- **Services**: `NotificationService` with parent honor notification capabilities

### Frontend Components
- **Layout**: Custom sidebar and header components for parent interface
- **Pages**: 6 main pages covering all parent functions
- **Components**: Reusable UI components following the existing design system

## üîê Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- Only users with `user_role = 'parent'` can access parent routes

- Honor tracking limited to children's achievements
- Profile management restricted to own account
- Certificate access limited to children's earned certificates

## üìä Database Relationships

### Parent-Student Model
```php
// User model relationships
public function students(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(User::class, 'parent_student_relationships', 'parent_id', 'student_id')
                ->withPivot(['relationship_type', 'emergency_contact', 'notes'])
                ->withTimestamps();
}

public function parentRelationships(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(ParentStudentRelationship::class, 'parent_id');
}
```

### ParentStudentRelationship Model
- **parent_id**: Reference to parent user
- **student_id**: Reference to student user
- **relationship_type**: Father, Mother, Guardian, Other
- **emergency_contact**: Emergency contact information
- **notes**: Additional relationship notes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure the `parent_student_relationships` table exists and is properly seeded with parent-student relationships.

### 2. User Creation
Create parent accounts with `user_role = 'parent'` and link them to student accounts through the relationship table.

### 3. Route Access
Parent routes are automatically loaded through the `bootstrap/app.php` configuration.

### 4. Email Configuration
Ensure Gmail SMTP is properly configured for honor qualification notifications.

## üîç Usage Examples

### Viewing Children's Grades
```typescript
// Navigate to grades page
<Link href={route('parent.grades.index')}>
  <Button>View Grades</Button>
</Link>

// Select specific child
<Select value={selectedStudentId} onValueChange={handleStudentChange}>
  {linkedStudents.map((student) => (
    <SelectItem key={student.id} value={student.id.toString()}>
      {student.name}
    </SelectItem>
  ))}
</Select>
```

### Accessing Honor Status
```typescript
// Navigate to honors page
<Link href={route('parent.honors.index')}>
  <Button>View Honors</Button>
</Link>

// Display honor information
{honors.map((honor) => (
  <div key={honor.id}>
    <h3>{honor.honor_type?.name}</h3>
    <p>{honor.academic_level?.name}</p>
  </div>
))}
```
